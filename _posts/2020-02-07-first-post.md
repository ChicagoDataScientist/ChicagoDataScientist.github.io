Introduction
Every year, between one and three million Americans apply for Social Security Disability Insurance, or SSDI. Cases are reviewed by an Administrative Law Judge, or ALJ. These cases represent about one-third of all the civil cases in the United States involving the federal government.
The Social Security adjudication system has consistently been plagued with delays and backlogs, thus delaying and preventing disabled Americans from getting the help they need. Since 1999, the number of applicants has dramatically increased , but the number of ALJ approvals has not.
Additionally, the extremely divergent rate of case approvals by ALJs, shows great inconsistency in the decision making process and undermines the concept of fair, impartial justice.
ALJs, on average, are expected to make decisions on 500â€“700 cases per year, often creating a backlog of cases. This results in disabled people often waiting a year or more to have their case heard and get the relief they need. In cases where applicants must appeal, their wait is even longer.
